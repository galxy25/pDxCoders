Agenda Project Requirements & User Story Generation

Item 1 Open Source License Comparison/Discussion (20 minutes)

	Discuss and come to a consensus on what licenses are preferred for this project.

	-Owner: Brandon Isom
	-Outcome
		Decided that MIT license would be best for this project, still waiting to hear back from their funding source regarding any restrictions.

Item 2 Project Architecture (45 minutes)
	Discuss and decide on the core functionality of the system to be built. For example, 
	User Authentication
		Use OAUTH primamrly
		Email
		password
			Accounts contain
				User Location
				User image?
	User Management 
		Users are
			Admins
			Students
			Instructors
			Content Creators(could be merged into either admin or instructor role...)
				A group of students can be associated with one teacher
	Content Authoring
		Both single card  creation and bulk content uploading.
		Future exporting of cards/content desirable 
	Lesson Creation 
		Custom logic within the lesson-i.e. if a user gets one type of card wrong, show them more cards of the same type.
	Number of concurrent users
	Future Extesnsibility
	Privacy & Security Requirements	

        -Owner: Evan & Christof 
        -Outcome
		Added areas of project architecture:
			Course Creation
				With custom logic between lessons
			Social Media Sharing
			Content Management
				Playlists
					Orderable
				One to many and one to one sharing 
			Progress Tracker/Achievement&Reward system
				Badges, thumbs up/likes by fellow users
 
			Platform analytics
				Time spent on each card, course/lesson progress, time spent in system
Item 3 User Story Generation (55 minutes)
	Create user stories and use cases of the systems, focusing on happy paths and edge cases
See: http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm
        -Owner: Presented by Levi, then break into teams to write stories
        -Outcome
		Wrote many user stories on index cards which will soon be turned into Pivotal Tracker stories 

Action Items:

Additional Discussion Items:
	Concerns about protecting location and contact information of children users.
	What is the place of messaging/communication within the platform? Should it occur within the platform or in existing platforms(email, social media)
	What types of media will the system have? 
		Text for sure, probably images, and perhaps audio/video
	What type of offline compatibility do we need to build?
		 For a web app, we can start with zero, but with a robust API it will be easy for future iOS/Android apps to download content for offline viewing.
	How does the future scale of this project affect our day one design? 
		It needs to be designed to work seamlessly in a distributed system in the future. 500 users the first year, 10,000 by year 5.
	Creation of games is more important to them than the adaptive learning aspect.
